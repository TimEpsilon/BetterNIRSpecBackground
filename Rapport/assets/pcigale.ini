# distance computed from the redshift), the filter (for instance FUV) or
# line names (prefixed with 'line.' for the latter, for instance
# line.H-alpha) for the fluxes, and the names of the physical properties
# as computed by the code (e.g. dust.luminosity). The uncertainties are

# proerties. Fluxes can be positive or negative. Upper limits are
# indicated with a negative value for the uncertainty. In case some
# fluxes are missing for some entries, they can be replaced with NaN.
